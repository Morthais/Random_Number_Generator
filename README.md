# Overview

This is a random number generator built using Python. It takes an empty array, asks the user how long the array should be, and generates an array of random numbers. That array is then written to a file called random.txt and that same file is read to print the array and a message of its length to the screen.

I wrote the software to reinforce and expand my skill with the basics of the Python programming language.
